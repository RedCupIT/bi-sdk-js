## [2.0.0] - 2023-01-09
### Added
- Support for authenticating with Auth0 and Okta in the example app

### Changed
- Rename instances of `Credential` to `Passkey`
- Nest tenantId, realmId, and identityId under appropriate objects in the `Credential`
- Update support links in the example app

### Fixed
- Scheme without a path is now recognized as a valid URL when binding a credential
- Issues where SWC wasn't able to compile the JS SDK

## [1.0.10] - 2022-10-17

### Changed
- Existing example app to match the [getting-started](https://github.com/gobeyondidentity/getting-started) app.

### Fixed
- An issue where the SDK was failing to compile after being added as a package from npm.

## [1.0.9] - 2022-09-20
### Added
- Logger callback to initialize function. This enables users of the SDK to specify where logs generated by the SDK are output, and to silence logs by not specifying a logger callback.
- New attributes to the `Credential` model. `Tenant` now has a `displayName` and `Identity` contains a `primaryEmailAddress`.
### Changed
- Replaced existing `authenticate` function with one that now takes two arguments, `url`and `credentialID`. This is now inline with how consumers of the SDK have been using this function.
### Removed
- Optimizely dependency. There will no longer be an error displayed in the console related to Optimizely whenever the SDK is initialized.
### Fixed
- The SDK no longer bundles modules as `eval(...)` expressions, rather minified JS.
